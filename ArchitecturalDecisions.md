# Application Architecture

The rough plan at the moment is to utilize the *MVVM* pattern, encapsulated within a higher *Service Layer Architecture* pattern. The application will be divided up into three main layers, each with their own service library, as well as a test layer. The individual layers will themselves be divided up further where necessary, and I will implement different versions of some of the layers as the need arises.
